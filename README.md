<H3>The following are the 5 different hand gestures or actions that Iâ€™ve programmed for demonstration purpose.</H3>

<b>Gesture 1:</b> Place your hand in front of the Right Ultrasonic Sensor at a distance (between 15CM to 35CM) for a small duration and move your hand away from the sensor. This gesture will Scroll Down the Web Page or Decrease the Volume.<br>
<b>Gesture 2:</b> Place your hand in front of the Right Ultrasonic Sensor at a distance (between 15CM to 35CM) for a small duration and move your hand towards the sensor. This gesture will Scroll up the Web Page or Increase the Volume.<br>
<b>Gesture 3:</b> Swipe your hand in front of the Right Ultrasonic Sensor. This gesture will move to the Next Tab.<br>
<b>Gesture 4:</b> Swipe your hand in front of the Left Ultrasonic Sensor. This gesture will move to the Previous Tab or Play/Pause the Video.<br>
<b>Gesture 5:</b> Swipe your hand across both the sensors (Left Sensor first). This action will Switch between Tasks.<br>

<H4>Copy the Arduino Code from Arduino Foulder and paste the code in Arduino IDE</H4>
<H4>Now open Python2.7+ IDLE and Paste the Python Code and Run the Program</H4>
